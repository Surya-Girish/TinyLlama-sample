# TinyLlama Sample
A sample run for QLoRA based fine-tuning for an open-source llm, TinyLlama to be able to diagnose diseases from given symptoms based on the master dataset.
The notebook includes, data preperation, loading and training of model and tokenizer, saving both into local files and testing their effectiveness on a test-dataset with a confusion matrix.
Due to computational limitations, the model's behaviour isn't always consistent. But, 5 out of 10 trial runs have given a credible diagnosis. 

Note: The uploaded notebook outputs have elements which make it unviewable in the preview on git. Please download the file to view the code and outputs. 

NOTE: This is only a sample trial, the diagnosis are not to be used in real life.
